Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework to build mobile-first responsive websites by [Mark Otto.](https://twitter.com/mdo) It has a fluent and powerful grid system to build responsive layouts and control them at specific break-points. Its ready-made UI components make the development process easier and faster. Bootstrap uses SASS under the hood to build the framework. That helps in customizing the framework from a single variables file. If needed, we can import only the necessary components and mix with other UI libraries. Bootstrap has its own icons library, official themes and is moving towards the release of V5. There are many third-party plugins and free themes which makes people go for Bootstrap.
