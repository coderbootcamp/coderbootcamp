I always wanted to have a dedicated page for each programming language, framework, library and service I interact with that aggregates different aspects like the team, surrounding ecosystem, people to follow and more. Initially I have built this website to serve as an anchor to my full-stack course but I am not going in that direction anymore. So I thought, why I could not do what I always wanted and see what happens?  And here it is. I want to start slow, get the feedback from the developers and improve the site so that the content can deliver some value.
